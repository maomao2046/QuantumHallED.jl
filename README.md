# QuantumHallED (QHED)

A Julia code (built on Julia v0.6.0) for performing exact diagonalization of quantum Hall systems, i.e., interacting electrons moving in two spatial dimensions in the presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field. Currently the code supports only the spherical geometry, as introduced in the classic paper by Haldane \[[PRL **51**, 605 (1983)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.51.605)\].

Included are a few Jupyter [notebooks](https://github.com/mishmash/QuantumHallED/tree/master/notebooks) demonstrating usage:
* [sphere-ED.ipynb](https://github.com/mishmash/QuantumHallED/blob/master/notebooks/sphere-ED.ipynb): various examples of basic usage.
* [Rezayi-Read_sphere-CFL.ipynb](https://github.com/mishmash/QuantumHallED/blob/master/notebooks/Rezayi-Read_sphere-CFL.ipynb): calculate energy spectra and (density-density) pair correlation function for the compressible composite Fermi liquid state realized for Coulomb interactions in the half-filled lowest Landau level \[see [Rezayi and Read, PRL **72**, 900 (1994)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.72.900)\].
* [Li-Haldane_entanglement-spectrum.ipynb](https://github.com/mishmash/QuantumHallED/blob/master/notebooks/Li-Haldane_entanglement-spectrum.ipynb): calculate (orbital partition) entanglement spectra for the ground state of the Coulomb interaction projected into the first excited ("second") Landau level, believed to realize the Moore-Read Pfaffian state \[see [Li and Haldane, PRL **101**, 010504 (2008)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.010504)\].
